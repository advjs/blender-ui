## Usage

```bash
# not published yet
pnpm add @advjs/blender-ui
```

## Why?

- I'm developing editors for some projects ([advjs](https://github.com/YunYouJun/advjs) and others), I hope their UI to be refined and uniform.
- Blender is a great 3D software, its UI is also great and fits well with editors.
